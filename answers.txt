Q1: Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?
A1: Fix 2 because the transformed data are normally distributed and with equal varaince. Doing T-test on this kind of data makes perfect sense

Q2: I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.
A2: The results from U-test on original data and T-test on transformed data reflect that the comments counts on weekend and weekday are different because both tests have near-0 pvalue. We can confidently reject the null hypothesis which assumes that comments counts on weekends and weekdays are same

Q3: Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)
A3: U-test seems to do a better job because of 2 reasons:
1) it's easiest to implement (just call the library)
2) The pvalue from this test is the lowest (pvalue=4.3122266173669665e-53). With this low value, we are super confident to reject the null hypothesis

Q4: When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?
A4: Through the plot, we can clearly see that weekdays got more comments
